Most of us hardly have time to cook dinner, much less dig up our senator's contacts and give them a call. That's where The Democracy Project comes in. Our mission is to offer streamlined solutions to a few simple questions:",

    text: "In a world where we all have computers in out pockets, there's no reason why it should be so hard to get involved.

When you register, you are automatically connected with your state and district representatives, giving you easy access to all of their socials and contacts.

You'll have access to summaries and discussion boards to make informed decisions on the issues, and then you can let your representatives know how you feel with realtime voting.",

    text: "In recent years it has become apparent that our polling system is deeply flawed. Many question whether it can be trusted to yield meaningful insight about the electorate. Instead of polling 10 or 30 thousand people, The Democracy Project gives millions a way to express their positions directly and in real time.",
